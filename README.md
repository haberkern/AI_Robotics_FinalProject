This is my Final Project assignment for the Udacity AI for Robotics course.

This is a work in progress...

I decided to try an extended kalman filter on it using a constant velocity/yaw rate model.
I used the following tutorial to help me with this filter.

Thank you for the great work, Dresden!

If you are working on this class, please don't use this code.
 - you'll get more out of it by going through the struggle and...
 - you can do a heck of a lot better than this.
 - my first version used a PID with no kalman filtering at all and did just as well.
